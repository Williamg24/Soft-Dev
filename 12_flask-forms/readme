DISCO:
- We can specify the method of a form using the `method` attribute
- In order to get the data posted to the server, we need to use `request.form` instead of `request.args`
- A GET request fetches content from the server (ex. HTML, CSS) and a POST request sends data to a server (ex. username, password, info)
