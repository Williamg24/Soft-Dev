Q: WYSIWYG?
A:WYSIWYG stands for "What You See Is What You Get." It is a term used to describe software or applications that allow users to see a visual representation of the final product as they are creating it. This means that the user interface displays the document, image, or web page as it will appear when printed or published, without requiring the user to have any knowledge of the underlying code or formatting.
WYSIWYG editors are commonly used in word processors, desktop publishing software, web development tools, and other applications that require users to create visual content. The advantage of WYSIWYG editors is that they can help users create high-quality, professional-looking documents or websites without needing to have specialized technical skills.
However, the downside of WYSIWYG editors is that they can sometimes generate bloated or inefficient code, or limit the flexibility of the user in creating customized designs. For this reason, some advanced users prefer to work with code editors and other tools that allow for more precise control over the formatting and structure of the content they are creating.

Q: "Nexus" vs WWW?
A:"Nexus" and the World Wide Web (WWW) are both terms used to describe systems for organizing and accessing information over the internet, but they are different in several ways.
Nexus is a hypothetical information retrieval system that was proposed in a 1960 article by American computer scientist Ted Nelson. Nexus was envisioned as a system that would allow users to create and link together collections of digital documents, forming a complex network of interlinked information that could be easily navigated and searched.
The World Wide Web, on the other hand, is a real system that was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee. The Web uses a system of hyperlinks to connect web pages and other digital content into a vast network of interlinked information that can be accessed through web browsers.
While both Nexus and the Web aim to make it easier to access and navigate large collections of information, they differ in their approach. Nexus emphasizes the ability to link together discrete pieces of information in a flexible and customizable way, while the Web emphasizes the ability to link together entire documents (web pages) and other digital content in a standardized way.
In practice, the World Wide Web has become the dominant system for organizing and accessing information over the internet, while Nexus remains a relatively obscure concept that has not been widely implemented.

Q: What did the great browser wars entail?
A: The "browser wars" were a series of heated competition and innovation between Microsoft and Netscape in the mid-to-late 1990s to dominate the web browser market. At the time, web browsers were still a relatively new technology, and there was a lot of uncertainty about what the future of the web would look like. Both companies saw the potential for huge profits in the emerging web market and were willing to invest heavily to gain an advantage.
The browser wars began in earnest in 1995 when Microsoft released its own web browser, Internet Explorer (IE), as part of its Windows 95 operating system. At the time, Netscape Navigator was the dominant browser, but Microsoft quickly gained ground by bundling IE with its operating system and offering it for free. This move was seen as anticompetitive by many, and in 1998 the US Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.
Meanwhile, both companies were engaged in a frenzied cycle of innovation, adding new features and improving performance in their respective browsers. JavaScript was introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0, and Internet Explorer soon followed suit with its own version of the scripting language. Both browsers also added support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which allowed web designers to create more sophisticated and visually appealing web pages.
The browser wars came to a head in the late 1990s when Microsoft's market share surpassed Netscape's for the first time. Netscape responded by releasing an open-source version of its browser, called Mozilla, which eventually led to the development of Firefox. Meanwhile, Microsoft continued to bundle IE with Windows and aggressively market it to users.
The browser wars had a profound impact on the development of the web and the technology industry as a whole. They helped to drive innovation in web technologies and fueled the growth of the internet as a platform for commerce, communication, and entertainment. The battles between Microsoft and Netscape also set the stage for future antitrust investigations and debates over the role of government regulation in the tech industry.
