        <li><h3> What is node?</h3>
            <p>
                Developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009, Node is an <b><u><i>open-source and cross platfrom JavaScript runtime environment</i></u></b>.
                It can be used to generate dynamic web page content, manipulate files on a server, collect form data, and modify data in database. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h3> Core Node concepts</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li> <u>Asynchronous</u>
                    <ul><p>
                        Node's non-blocking architecture allows tasks to run simultaneously resulting in fast response times. All APIs of node.js are asynchronous meaning the 
                        server never waits for a return data and it directly moves onto the next call. This is achieved through notification mechanism of Events in Node.js that gets
                        responses from previous API calls. 
                        (For more information: <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asynchronous-non-blocking-nature-nodejs-shehan-chanuka/">check this out</a>)
                    </p></ul>
                </li>
                <li> <u>Event-driven Programming</u>
                    <ul><p>
                        Once an event (any action that the device perfoms: fire, create, listen (for node)) is triggered or completed, a callback function
                        is run which only occurs in response to that event. This allows Node.js to be lightweight and memory efficient. 
                    </p></ul>
                </li>
                <li> <u>Single Threaded Architecture</u>
                    <ul><p>
                        Node.Js utilizes the Libuv library along with asynchronous calling to handle thousands of concurrent threads efficiently. This is all done
                        in the same thread which make it highly scalable and popular among top companies such as NASA, Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn and more. 
                    </p></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h3> Modules</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to libraries in JavaScript, modules of node.js allows you use to a variety of functions. In node, there are 3 types of modules:
                <ul>
                    <li> Core modules - built in modules in node that are available once node is installed</li>
                    <li> Local modules - modules that are created by the user in the same folder as the file you are running</li>
                    <li> Third-party modules - modules that are created by other people and require installation through the npm</li>
                </ul> 
            </br>
                In order to utilize a module, a require function is need in the format of <b> const var_name = require('module_name') </b>. For any local modules,
                methods use the <b> export() </b> keyword to make functions in that file avilable to other files. 
                Node has multiple modules for users to use but here are some of the more popular ones:
                <ul> 
                    <li> <u>HTTP module</u>, which allows node.js to transfer data over the http. It can create a web server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to clients</li>
                    <li> <u>File system module</u>, which allows you to work with files on your computer such as reading, writing, and editing them. One to to note is that all file system functions have an asynchronous and synchronous form depending on the developers requirements.  </li>
                    <li> <u>Console module</u>, which like the name suggests would allow you to print statements into the console. This is great for debugging code. </li>
                </ul> 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h3> Npm</h3>
            <p>
               NPM stands for <u> node package manager</u> and this is automatically installed for you upon installation of node. Npm allows you to install packages which contain all the files required to use a module. 
               To install a package, use the command <b> npm install package_name</b> and this will be stored in seperate folder named "node_modules" in the main folder. 
            </p>

                            <li>
                                Bad for heavy CPU intensive tasks since it's single-threaded. For instance, if a huge request or event is in the event loop, it'll slow down processing speed. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “Callback hell issue” where callbacks are nested within other callbacks, making it hard to understand the code.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inadequately made and documented packages from NPM or just straight up incomplete ones. 
                            </li>
